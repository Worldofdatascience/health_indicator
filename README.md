1. What problem is this solving?
People are terrible judge of their own health and that's largely due to a lack of a metric that they can refer to for their health. It's a hidden metric, and the task here is to reveal it.

2. What am I building?
I'm building a tool that allows users to enter common fitness metrics and that will be used to generate one single fitness score.


3. Why the market is interesting?
People are interested in their body more than ever, as can be seen with the large fitness wearable market.
